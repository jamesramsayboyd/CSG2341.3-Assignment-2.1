Machine Learning is a powerful technology where machines are trained to develop their own algorithms to solve problems too large or complex for human-written code. Machine learning is used to solve some of the most pressing problems facing our society today, identifying ways to halt climate change (***source #1***), improving the accuracy of medical diagnoses (*** source #2 ***), and predicting pitfalls in financial markets before they happen (*** source #3 ***). 

This paper will cover three different approaches to machine learning. Random Forest learning is a technique where points of data are sent down branching paths, . It has recently been used to predict the spread of the COVID-19 and estimate the future number of daily cases reported (*** source #4 ***). 

The XXXX algorithm

The k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm blah blah (*** source #6***).

The Approaches section will go into greater depth on each of the three Machine Learning techniques, with a detailed description of the algorithmic steps involved and an analysis of their performance against a dataset. In the Performance Comparison section, the three Machine Learning implementations will be pitted against eachother using a common dataset in order to compare their relative performance and determine their strengths and weaknesses. Code for all three implementations can be found in the Appendix.
